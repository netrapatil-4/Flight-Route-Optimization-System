# Route Planning Project
# Flight Route Optimization System

## Overview
The Flight Route Optimization System is a C++ project that computes the shortest and most efficient flight route between two locations using graph-based path planning algorithms. It processes real-world map data and applies classical search techniques to determine optimal routes.

This project focuses on algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and performance-oriented system design.
